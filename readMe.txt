I'm using a dummy database since this app is for authentication demonstration only, using a custom jwt api and a express-jwt middleware.Furthermore, The rest-api uses has ApiService class to interact with the database.

Also, since the users have encrypted passwords,you need to type in thefollowing password if you're using one of these users:

John Doe:
-email: john@gmail.com
-password: john123

Peter Thompson:
-email: peter@gmail.com
-password: peter123

Anne Smith
-email: anne@gmail.com
-password: anne123
