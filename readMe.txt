This project is a demonstration app built using Express.js for the backend and Handlebars (HBS) for the frontend. The app simulates a user authentication system with custom JWT middleware and a dummy database for data storage.

Key Features
 - Custom JWT Middleware: Handles the signing, decoding, and verification of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate users.

- API for JSON Web Tokens: A custom API to sign, decode, and verify JWTs, providing a lightweight approach to token management.

- Dummy Database: A simulated database (DbService class) that contains user and tenant data for demonstration purposes.

- Frontend Simulation: Handlebars (HBS) templates are used on the frontend with JavaScript to simulate an AJAX-like interaction similar to React.

Also, since the users have encrypted passwords,you need to type in thefollowing password if you're using one of these users:

John Doe:
-email: john@gmail.com
-password: john123

Peter Thompson:
-email: peter@gmail.com
-password: peter123

Anne Smith
-email: anne@gmail.com
-password: anne123
